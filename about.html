            <h2>Who We Are <span class="dot"></span></h2>
            <p>
                Ever found yourself scrolling through Instagram at 2 AM, looking at those travel reels, thinking, "Yaar, I need a vacation"? We've been there. And that's exactly why Traowl India exists!
            </p>
            <p>
                We're not just another travel company trying to fill your itinerary with the usual touristy spots. For us, travelling is about that chai break at a roadside dhaba on a long road trip, not sleeping throughout the night to catch the most amazing sunrise, and the strangers who became your best friends after a crazy night under the stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                We get it—traveling can be overwhelming. The flight bookings, hotel searches, figuring out the best local experiences—sometimes, planning feels like a full-time job. That's where we step in. Think of us as your travel besties who've already done the research, made the mistakes, and found the coolest experiences, so you don't have to. And these experiences, trust us, will change your life.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Purpose & Path Forward <span class="dot"></span></h2>
            <p>
                At Traowl India, we believe that travel isn't just about adventure; it's also about responsibility. That's why we're committed to eco-friendly tourism—minimizing waste, supporting local communities, and making sure the places we visit stay as beautiful as they are. We work hard to make travel affordable without compromising the experience. We believe in offering great value that lets you focus on having fun, not on how much you're spending.
            </p>
            <p>
                We curate experiences that go beyond the ordinary. Before we take you anywhere, we go there first. We explore, test, and refine every experience to make sure you get the best. From finding offbeat locations to handpicking the best activities, we create trips that aren't just about sightseeing—they're about living the moment. Every trip has a Trip Captain—your go-to person, friend, and guide who makes sure everything runs smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, our mission is to build an environment where female travelers can roam freely without worries and where everyone can join in and feel welcomed—because let's face it: travel is meant to be liberating, not stressful. You deserve to enjoy every moment without thinking twice.
